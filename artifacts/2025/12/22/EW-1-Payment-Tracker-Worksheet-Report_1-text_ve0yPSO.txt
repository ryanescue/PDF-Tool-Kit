Additional Payments May Be Available
Replacement Cost - Personal Property
Your policy may provide for additional payments on a replacement cost basis for some of your personal property items.
The personal property items must be repaired or replaced within a specified period of time in order to present a claim for additional payments on a replacement cost basis.
Please refer to your policy for specific time limits and additional settlement provisions.   Following repair or replacement, please submit your documentation to us referring to
the claim number and item number.
If an insured replaces a lost or damaged item, replacement cost benefits may be paid.   If the item has not been replaced, the claim will be paid based on actual cash value.
Actual cash value (ACV) is calculated by determining the replacement cost (RC) of the item and then subtracting depreciation (ACV = RC – depreciation).   The amount of the
depreciation is based on age, quality, and condition of the property at the time of the loss.
The item’s effective age is used in calculating depreciation.  If the item’s condition is classified as average, then the effective age is the same as the actual age.  If the item’s
condition is classified as above average  orbelow average , the effective age of the item is determined by adjusting the actual age by a factor of 1.4 for below average  and .6 for
above average .   As a result, an item that is 10 years old in below average  condition has an effective age of 14 years (10 years x 1.4).   An item that is 10 years old in above
average condition has an effective age of 6 years (10 years x .6).
Regardless of the age, if an item is useable for its intended purpose, depreciation does not exceed 80%.  If the item is replaced within the time allowed by the policy, the
depreciation previously deducted may be paid up to the amount spent to replace the item or the agreed upon replacement cost for that item, whichever is less.   All the terms and
conditions of the insurance policy apply.
If you have any questions, please contact your claim handler.
