Understanding
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
U.S.
 
veterans
 
and
 
their
 
families
 
with
 
a
 
non-clinical
 
mental-health
 
companion
 
that
 
offers
 
supportive
 
conversations,
 
mood
 
tracking,
 
and
 
links
 
to
 
veteran
 
resources.
 
 
The
 
project
 
uses
 
Django,
 
Bootstrap,
 
OpenAI’s
 
API,
 
and
 
Google
 
Maps/Places.
 
Core
 
features
 
include
 
AI
 
chat,
 
a
 
mood
 
tracker
 
dashboard,
 
authentication,
 
a
 
vet-facility
 
locator,
 
and
 
resource
 
pages.
 
 
Problem-Solving
 
Sean
 
said
 
that
 
some
 
major
 
challenges
 
were
 
handling
 
errors
 
in
 
Django
 
views,
 
especially
 
when
 
certain
 
branches
 
returned
 
None
 
and
 
caused
 
500
 
errors.
 
He
 
seems
 
to
 
have
 
resolved
 
this
 
through
 
better
 
validation,
 
HTTP
 
method
 
decorators,
 
and
 
more
 
explicit
 
returns
 
in
 
the
 
veterans_nearby
 
and
 
profile
 
views.
 
Another
 
challenge
 
was
 
safely
 
and
 
properly
 
storing
 
API
 
keys.
 
This
 
issue
 
was
 
solved
 
using
 
a
 
.env
 
setup.
 
Creativity
 
shows
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
AI
 
guardrails,
 
custom
 
mood-detection
 
logic,
 
and
 
the
 
fallback
 
resource
 
system
 
in
 
openai_utility.py.
 
 
Code
 
Quality
 
The
 
code
 
is
 
generally
 
readable
 
and
 
well-structured.
 
I
 
like
 
the
 
consistent
 
and
 
concise
 
comments
 
to
 
help
 
me
 
understand
 
what
 
I'm
 
looking
 
at.
 
His
 
functions
 
are
 
broken
 
into
 
logical
 
sections
 
(auth,
 
chat,
 
mood
 
tracking,
 
locator).
 
The
 
vars
 
naming
 
scheme
 
makes
 
sense
 
and
 
the
 
OpenAI
 
utility
 
is
 
documented
 
well.
 
Models
 
are
 
organized
 
with
 
useful
 
indexes
 
and
 
helper
 
methods
 
like
 
MoodEntry.last_for_user().
 
 
I
 
was
 
able
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
project
 
successfully.
 
And
 
the
 
website
 
is
 
working
 
correctly
 
on
 
all
 
web
 
browsers.
 
The
 
account
 
creation
 
flow
 
works
 
and
 
I
 
really
 
enjoy
 
the
 
password
 
strength
 
indicator.
 
The
 
mood
 
tracker
 
displays
 
a
 
functional
 
data
 
plot,
 
and
 
the
 
VA
 
locator
 
correctly
 
uses
 
the
 
browser’s
 
location.
 
 
Issues
 
Noticed
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
some
 
UI
 
elements
 
have
 
low
 
contrast
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
nav
 
bar
 
and
 
resources
 
page,
 
making
 
text
 
hard
 
to
 
read.
 
I
 
think
 
maybe
 
making
 
the
 
boxes
 
where
 
the
 
text
 
is
 
held
 
maybe
 
50
 
percent
 
opacity
 
or
 
having
 
a
 
small
 
white
 
stroke
 
could
 
improve
 
the
 
readability.
 
 
 
It
 
seems
 
as
 
if
 
the
 
chat
 
sometimes
 
throws
 
a
 
server
 
error
 
when
 
the
 
message
 
includes
 
“sad”
 
or
 
“sadness.”
 
I
 
possibly
 
think
 
that
 
this
 
may
 
come
 
from
 
mood-detection
 
conditions
 
or
 
the
 
API
 
call
 
returning
 
None.
 
 
It’s
 
not
 
immediately
 
obvious
 
how
 
to
 
view
 
previous
 
chat
 
history.
 
The
 
system
 
does
 
seem
 
to
 
remember
 
context
 
but
 
doesn’t
 
visibly
 
display
 
old
 
messages.
 
Maybe
 
having
 
 
 
 
Recommendations
 
Improve
 
UI
 
readability
 
Make
 
the
 
resources
 
section
 
and
 
navbar
 
less
 
transparent
 
or
 
add
 
a
 
thin
 
stroke
 
or
 
solid
 
background
 
to
 
improve
 
contrast.
 
 
Fix
 
“sad”
 
→
 
server
 
error
 
bug
 
Maybe
 
add
 
debugging
 
around
 
the
 
mood-detection
 
block
 
in
 
chat()
 
to
 
confirm
 
whether
 
the
 
issue
 
is
 
inside
 
keyword
 
scanning
 
or
 
inside
 
the
 
OpenAI
 
API
 
call.
 
 
Maybe
 
a
 
little
 
Enhance
 
to
 
the
 
chat
 
experience
 
by
 
adding
 
a
 
visible
 
scrollable
 
chat
 
history
 
or
 
a
 
“pop-out
 
chat
 
window”
 
so
 
users
 
can
 
see
 
their
 
previous
 
messages
 
for
 
the
 
session.
 
 
Suggested
 
Feature
 
Additions
 
Auto-populate
 
mood
 
tracker
 
from
 
chat
 
(you
 
already
 
have
 
partial
 
detection):
 
If
 
a
 
user
 
says
 
“I’m
 
doing
 
amazing,”
 
automatically
 
log
 
that
 
mood
 
with
 
a
 
timestamp.
 
 
Saved
 
chat
 
logs
 
per
 
day:
 
Users
 
might
 
appreciate
 
reviewing
 
past
 
sessions
 
similar
 
to
 
a
 
journal.
 
 
Overall
 
Reviewing
 
this
 
code
 
helped
 
me
 
better
 
understand
 
how
 
to
 
integrate
 
AI
 
services
 
into
 
my
 
app,
 
how
 
to
 
structure
 
Django
 
views
 
for
 
both
 
GET/POST
 
logic,
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
maintain
 
session-aware
 
data
 
like
 
moods
 
and
 
whatnot.
 
I
 
was
 
impressed
 
by
 
the
 
safety-focused
 
design
 
of
 
the
 
AI
 
system
 
role
 
and
 
the
 
structured
 
fallback
 
logic.
